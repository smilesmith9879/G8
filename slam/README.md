# SLAM Integration

This directory contains the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) integration for the AI Smart Four-Wheel Drive Car project.

## Overview

The current implementation includes a placeholder `slam_wrapper.py` that simulates SLAM functionality. In a real deployment, this would be replaced with actual ORB-SLAM3 integration.

## ORB-SLAM3 Integration

To integrate the real ORB-SLAM3 system:

1. Install ORB-SLAM3 following the instructions at [https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3)

2. Create Python bindings for ORB-SLAM3 or use a subprocess approach to communicate with the ORB-SLAM3 executable

3. Replace the placeholder functions in `slam_wrapper.py` with actual calls to the ORB-SLAM3 system

## Configuration

The SLAM system requires a calibrated camera. You should create a camera configuration file with the following parameters:

- Camera matrix (intrinsic parameters)
- Distortion coefficients
- Image dimensions
- Frame rate

Place this configuration file in this directory and update the `SLAMWrapper` class to use it.

## Performance Considerations

ORB-SLAM3 is computationally intensive. On a Raspberry Pi 5, you may need to:

1. Reduce the input image resolution
2. Lower the feature extraction threshold
3. Optimize the ORB-SLAM3 parameters for performance
4. Consider using a dedicated compute module for SLAM processing

## Map Visualization

The current implementation generates a simple 2D occupancy grid map. With the full ORB-SLAM3 integration, you can:

1. Extract the 3D point cloud
2. Generate a more detailed 2D occupancy grid
3. Create a 3D mesh for visualization
4. Implement path planning algorithms using the generated map
